# ViSiL: Fine-grained Spatio-Temporal Video Similarity Learning
This repository contains the Tensorflow implementation of the paper 
[ViSiL: Fine-grained Spatio-Temporal Video Similarity Learning](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Kordopatis-Zilos_ViSiL_Fine-Grained_Spatio-Temporal_Video_Similarity_Learning_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf). 
It provides code for the calculation of similarities between the query and database videos given by the user.
Also, it contains an evaluation script to reproduce the results of the paper. The video similarity calculation
is achieved by applying a frame-to-frame function that respects the spatial within-frame structure of videos and 
a learned video-to-video similarity function that also considers the temporal structure of videos. 

The PyTorch implementation of ViSiL can be found here [here](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/visil/tree/pytorch)

## Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Tensorflow 1.xx (tested with 1.8-1.15)

## Getting started

### Installation

* Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/visil
cd visil
```
* You can install all the dependencies by
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

* Download and unzip the pretrained model:
```bash
wget http://ndd.iti.gr/visil/ckpt.zip
unzip ckpt.zip
```

* If you want to use I3D as backbone network (used for AVR in the paper), then install the following packages:
```bash
# For tensoflow version >= 1.14
pip install tensorflow-probability==0.7 dm-sonnet

# For tensoflow version < 1.14
pip install tensorflow-probability==0.6 dm-sonnet==1.23
```

### Video similarity calculation
* Create a file that contains the query videos.
Each line of the file have to contain a video id and a path to the corresponding video file,
 separated by a tab character (\\t). Example:

        wrC_Uqk3juY queries/wrC_Uqk3juY.mp4
        k_NT43aJ_Jw queries/k_NT43aJ_Jw.mp4
        2n30dbPBNKE queries/2n30dbPBNKE.mp4
                                                 ...	
		

* Create a file with the same format for the database videos.

* Run the following command to calculate the similarity between all the query and database videos
```bash
python calculate_similarity.py --query_file queries.txt --database_file database.txt --model_dir model/
```

* For faster processing, you can load the query videos to the GPU memory by adding the flag  ```--load_queries```
```bash
python calculate_similarity.py --query_file queries.txt --database_file database.txt --model_dir model/ --load_queries
```

* The calculated similarities are stored to the file given to the ```--output_file```. The file is in JSON format and
contains a dictionary with every query id as keys, and another dictionary that contains the similarities of the dataset
videos to the corresponding queries as values. See the example below
```bash
    {
      "wrC_Uqk3juY": {
        "KQh6RCW_nAo": 0.716,
        "0q82oQa3upE": 0.300,
          ...},
      "k_NT43aJ_Jw": {
        "-KuR8y1gjJQ": 1.0,
        "Xb19O5Iur44": 0.417,
          ...},
      ....
    }
    ```
```

* Add flag `--help` to display the detailed description for the arguments of the similarity calculation script

  -s, --similarity_function SIMILARITY_FUNCTION   Function that will be used to calculate the
                                                  similarity between query-candidate frames and

### Evaluation
* We also provide code to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

* First, download the videos of the dataset you want. The supported options are:
    * [CC_WEB_VIDEO](http://vireo.cs.cityu.edu.hk/webvideo/) - Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval 
    * [FIVR-5K, FIVR-200K](http://ndd.iti.gr/fivr/) - Fine-grained Incident Video Retrieval
    * [EVVE](http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/evve/) - Event-based Video Retrieval 
    * [ActivityNet](http://activity-net.org/) - Action  Video  Retrieval

* Determine the pattern based on the video id that the source videos are stored. For example,
 if all dataset videos are stored in a folder with filename the video id and the extension `.mp4`,
 then the pattern is `{id}.mp4`. If each dataset video is stored in a different folder based on their
 video id with filename `video.mp4`, then the pattern us `{id}/video.mp4`.
    * The code replaces the `{id}` string with the id of the videos in the dataset
    * Also, it support supports Unix style pathname pattern expansion. For example, if video files have 
    various extension, then the pattern can be e.g. `{id}/video.*`
    * For FIVR-200K, EVVE, ActivityNet, the Youtube ids are considered as the video ids
    * For CC_WEB_VIDEO, video ids derives from the number of the query set that the video belongs to, 
    and the basename of the file. In particular, the video ids are in form `<number_of_query_set>/<basename>`, e.g. `1/1_1_Y`

* Run the `evaluation.py` by providing the name of the evaluation dataset, the path to video files, 
the pattern that the videos are stored
```
python evaluation.py --dataset FIVR-5K --video_dir /path/to/videos/ --pattern {id}/video.* --load_queries
```

### Use ViSiL in your Python code

Here is a toy example to run ViSiL on any data.

```python
from model.visil import ViSiL
from datasets import load_video

# Load the two videos from the video files
query_video = load_video('/path/to/query/video')
target_video = load_video('/path/to/target/video')

# Initialize ViSiL model and load pre-trained weights
model = ViSiL('ckpt/resnet/')

# Extract features of the two videos
query_features = model.extract_features(query_video, batch_sz=32)
target_features = model.extract_features(target_video, batch_sz=32)

# Calculate similarity between the two videos
similarity = model.calculate_video_similarity(query_features, target_features)
```
